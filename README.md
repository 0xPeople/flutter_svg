# flutter_svg

Messing around with drawing SVGs on canvas

## Getting Started

For now, this requires the flutter/engine path_svg branch

you'll need to clone that, build it (see [instructions](https://github.com/flutter/engine/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)), and then use something like

`flutter run --local-engine=android_debug_unopt_x86` (to run a build for the android emulator, for example)

## SVG sample attribution
